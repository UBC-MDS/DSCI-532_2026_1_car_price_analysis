# Hybrid vs Fuel Vehicle Comparison Dashboard

This project presents an interactive dashboard designed to help environmentally conscious Uber drivers compare hybrid and standard fuel vehicles. Using vehicle data from Kaggle, the dashboard enables comparison across price categories, performance efficiency, body type, and engine size. The goal is to support informed decision making around the true cost premium and suitability of greener vehicle technologies.
