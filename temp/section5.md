## Description

The sketch illustrates a single page dashboard that enables comparison between hybrid and standard fuel vehicles across price category, efficiency, body type, and engine size.
It is designed for an environmentally conscious Uber driver to compare hybrid vehicles with standard fuel vehicles. The landing area at the top left provides a short title and  at the top right it includes a legend indicating fuel type (Hybrid vs Fuel), which is consistently encoded by color across all charts.

A filter panel on the left allows users to narrow the dataset while preserving the hybrid vs. fuel comparison. Filters include engine size, price category, performance efficiency, and body type.

The main chart visualizes vehicle distribution across price categories, split by fuel type, to highlight the cost premium of greener technology. Three supporting charts provide complementary insights: average performance efficiency (efficiency_score) by fuel type, Passenger capacity distribution (body type) by fuel type to assess ride suitability, and a scatter plot of engine size  vs. performance efficiency (efficiency_score) to reveal performance trade offs. Users can hover over chart elements to see tooltips with exact values (counts, averages, and points).
