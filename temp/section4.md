## Section 4: Exploratory Data Analysis

The first plot shows what type of fuel is the most efficient. Efficiency score is the normalized fuel efficiency of the vehicle. Our user may prioritize fuel efficiency when purchasing a car as any expense/running costs will eat into the revenue as an environmentally concious Uber/Lyft driver. The second plot shows the relationship between the price category and the efficiency score. This is important to understand as it may be the case that more expensive cars are more fuel efficient, which may be a factor in the user's decision making process when purchasing a car for ridesharing purposes. A high upfront cost may be justified if the car is more fuel efficient and thus has lower running costs, which may be more important to the user than the initial purchase price.
