## Section 1: Motivation and Purpose

**Our role:** Data scientist consultancy firm  
**Target audience:** Car buyers

Purchasing a car is one of the largest financial decisions most people make, yet the automotive market is complex — prices vary significantly based on brand, body type, fuel type, engine specifications, and manufacturing origin. Buyers often struggle to assess whether a vehicle is fairly priced relative to comparable options, or to understand which features drive price differences.

To address this, we propose building an interactive dashboard that allows car buyers to explore pricing patterns across different vehicle attributes. The app will visualize how factors such as brand, fuel type, body type, and engine performance relate to price, enabling buyers to compare vehicles, identify good-value segments, and make more informed purchasing decisions.
