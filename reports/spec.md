| 1 | When I explore brands and vehicle characteristics, I want to filter by brand, body type, fuel type, and price range so I can identify which combinations consistently fall into higher price segments.         | ✅ Implemented | Implemented via sidebar filters, KPI summaries, and average price by brand visualization.                                                |
| 2 | When I compare hybrid vehicles with standard fuel vehicles, I want to see differences in pricing and performance efficiency so I can evaluate the cost premium and efficiency tradeoffs of greener technology. | ✅ Implemented | Implemented via average price by fuel type and grouped efficiency comparison chart.                                                      |
| 3 | When I explore engineering characteristics, I want to study how engine size and horsepower relate to performance efficiency and price so I can detect pricing patterns across fuel types.                      | 🔄 Revised    | Original M1 story referenced vehicle age. Age-based analysis is planned for M3. Current implementation focuses on engineering variables. |

Reactivity requirements satisfied:

* `filtered_df` depends on four inputs.
* Multiple outputs consume `filtered_df`.
* `summary_kpis` depends on `filtered_df` and feeds two outputs.

## 2.4 Calculation Details

### filtered_df

Depends on:

* input_brand
* input_body_type
* input_price_range
* input_fuel_type

Transformation:

* Filters dataset by selected brand unless "All".
* Filters dataset by selected body type unless "All".
* Filters rows within selected price range.
* Filters dataset by selected fuel type unless "All".
* Returns the filtered dataframe.

Consumed by:

* fuel_eff_plot
* plot_brand_price
* scatter_engine_efficiency
* bar_fuel_efficiency
* plot_hp_price
* summary_kpis

---

### summary_kpis

Depends on:

* filtered_df

Transformation:

* Computes number of vehicles in filtered dataset.
* Computes average Price_USD.
* Returns a dictionary containing count and average price.

Consumed by:

* value_box_count
* value_box_avg_price

---

## Complexity Enhancement

### Reset Button

Triggered by:

* reset_btn

Implementation:

* Uses `@reactive.event(input.reset_btn)` and `@reactive.effect`.
* Resets brand, body type, and fuel type inputs to "All".
* Resets price range slider to full dataset range.

Rationale:

* Enables rapid return to baseline view.
* Improves usability during iterative filtering.
* Reduces friction in exploratory analysis.

## Milestone 4 Collaboration and Design Decisions

For Milestone 4, the team continued to follow a "pull request" based workflow where all changes are introduced through GitHub issues and reviewed before merging into the main branch.

### Work Organization

Tasks for this milestone were distributed across team members to ensure balanced contributions across code, documentation, testing, and release preparation. Each team member was responsible for a clearly defined area of work, and each resolved at least one feedback item collected in the M4 Feedback Prioritization issue.

### Design Before Implementation

For larger changes, including the advanced dashboard feature and the transition to Parquet + DuckDB, design decisions were documented in issues and specification updates before implementation. This helped ensure that the team had a shared understanding of the approach prior to coding.

### Pull Request Workflow

All work was submitted through scoped pull requests addressing a single feature or fix. Each pull request included clear commit messages and received at least one peer review before merging.

### Feedback Integration

Instructor and peer feedback from previous milestones was collected in a dedicated **M4 Feedback Prioritization issue**, where items were categorized as critical or non-critical. Critical items were addressed before release, and each team member resolved at least one feedback item through a corresponding pull request.

This process ensured transparency of decisions and traceability between issues, pull requests, and implementation changes.
